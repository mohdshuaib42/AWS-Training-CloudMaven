## Task 1:
## Created two VPCs
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (166).png>)


## Created subnets for each VPC 
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (167).png>)

## Created route Table for public subnets of VPC A and attached the IGW
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (168).png>)
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (169).png>)

## Creating peering connection so that VPC A and VPC B can communicate with each other
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (170).png>) 

## Here we're accepting peering connection request.
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (171).png>)


## Successfully updated route table for both VPCs i.e. added peering route.
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (172).png>)


## Here we three instances two in private subnet of each VPC and bastion in VPC-A public subnet.
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (173).png>)


## Below we connected to private ec2 of VPC-A through bastion.
![alt text](<Screenshots/Screenshot (174).png>)


## Then Connected to private EC2 of VPC-B through private EC2 of VPC-A that means our peering connection is seccessfull established.
